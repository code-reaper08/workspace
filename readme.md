Deploying a Coworking Space Analytics Application to Kubernetes
This document outlines the process of deploying a Coworking Space analytics application to a Kubernetes cluster using DevOps principles and tools.
Prerequisites
 * An AWS account with necessary permissions
 * eksctl installed for managing EKS clusters
 * kubectl installed for interacting with Kubernetes clusters
 * docker installed for building container images
 * Familiarity with CloudWatch for monitoring
Steps
 * Cluster Provisioning:
   * Utilize eksctl to create an EKS cluster on AWS. This step involves defining the cluster name, region, node group configuration, and desired number of nodes.
 * PostgreSQL Database Deployment:
   * Define Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) for persistent volume claims (PVCs), persistent volumes (PVs), and a Postgres deployment. These YAML files specify storage requirements and deployment configuration for the PostgreSQL database.
   * Alternatively, leverage Helm charts to install and configure a managed PostgreSQL instance within the cluster.
 * Analytics Application Testing:
   * Install application dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
   * Run the app.py script locally to verify application functionality.
   * Modify coworking.yaml and configmap.yaml to define deployment configurations and secrets for the application in the Kubernetes cluster.
   * Deploy these YAML files using kubectl apply -f deployment/ to create deployments and services for the analytics application and the database.
   * Test the deployed application APIs using curl commands to validate functionality and database connectivity.
 * Containerization:
   * Create a Dockerfile that defines the application build process. This typically involves using a Python base image and installing application dependencies within the container.
   * Build the Docker image locally using docker build -t <image_name> . to ensure a functional container is created.
 * ECR Repository:
   * Create an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repository to store the container image. This repository will serve as a private registry for our application images.
 * CI/CD Pipeline with CodeBuild:
   * Define a buildspec.yml file that specifies the build instructions for CodeBuild. This file references the Dockerfile and defines steps for building, tagging, and pushing the image to the ECR repository.
   * Create a CodeBuild project in the AWS console. Configure the project to use the buildspec.yml file, grant it access to the EKS cluster and ECR repository, and define any necessary environment variables.
   * Pushing code commits to the main branch will trigger the CodeBuild project. The project will build the Docker image using the Dockerfile, tag it with a unique identifier (e.g., build number), and push it to the ECR repository.
 * Deployment with Kubernetes Manifests:
   * Create Kubernetes deployment manifests that reference the container image stored in ECR. These manifests define how the application should be deployed within the cluster, including replicas, resource requests/limits, and environment variables.
   * Apply the deployment manifests using kubectl apply -f deployment/ to deploy the containerized application to the Kubernetes cluster.
 * Monitoring with CloudWatch:
   * Enable the Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on within the cluster. This add-on facilitates collecting and storing logs from applications running on the cluster.
   * Configure the CloudWatch agent on the cluster nodes to collect and send logs from the Coworking Space analytics application.
   * Access CloudWatch logs to monitor application health and troubleshoot any issues.
This approach leverages industry-standard tools like Kubernetes, Docker, ECR, and CodeBuild to achieve a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the Coworking Space analytics application. CloudWatch integration provides valuable insights into application behavior and facilitates proactive monitoring.
